# TRUST Framework Questionnaire for AI-Based Search Tools

**University of Twente -- EIS-IS Team**

> This document is the canonical specification for the TRUST framework evaluation questionnaire. It defines every field, section, and response option required to assess AI-based information search tools. Use this document as the authoritative reference when implementing the questionnaire in Microsoft Forms or any other platform.

## Persisted Review-Record Note (T001)

This document specifies the **questionnaire content**. Saved-review persistence adds a separate review-record envelope defined in:

- `docs/contracts/review-state-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/lifecycle-state-map.md`
- `docs/contracts/schema-versioning-policy.md`

The following persisted metadata are required by the T001 contracts and are **not** questionnaire response fields:

| Metadata field | Required | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| `review_id` | Yes | Stable internal identifier for the saved review record. |
| `public_id` | Yes | Stable human-facing identifier for routes, exports, and operator workflows. |
| `workflow_mode` | Yes | One of the current questionnaire workflow modes from `static/js/config/sections.js`; remains separate from lifecycle state. |
| `lifecycle_state` | Yes | Backend review-record lifecycle value from `docs/contracts/lifecycle-state-map.md`; not a questionnaire field. |
| `state_schema_version` | Yes | Persisted review-state schema version. Initial contract value: `"1"`. |
| `framework_version` | Yes | TRUST framework semantics version. Initial contract value: `"2.0"`. |
| `current_revision_number` | Yes | Monotonic immutable revision counter for the latest saved state. |
| `current_etag` | Yes | Opaque concurrency token for accepted writes. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | Yes | Saved-review record timestamps. |
| `created_by_user_id` | Yes | User identifier for the actor that created the review record. |

Questionnaire responses remain the inner `current_state_json` payload. The metadata above sit outside the questionnaire field inventory and must not be added to Appendix A field totals.

## Evidence Model Note (T002)

This document remains the canonical specification for **questionnaire prompts and reviewer-authored response fields**. It is **not** the canonical runtime or persistence model for evidence storage.

For T002, the authoritative runtime/persistence evidence model is defined in:

- `docs/contracts/evidence-model-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/evidence-manifest-compatibility.md`
- `docs/contracts/import-export-package-contract.md`

Interpret the evidence-related questionnaire labels in this document as follows:

- per-criterion `Evidence summary` and `Evidence links` remain questionnaire-spec prompts for reviewers, including legacy/import normalization needs;
- the runtime and persisted evidence model is one durable **asset + scoped link** system, not a separate primary `Evidence links` storage structure per criterion;
- Section `2.10 Evidence folder link` remains a workflow/documentation field describing a shared-location practice, not the canonical durable evidence record once backend evidence storage exists.

## Standard Answer Sets

The following answer sets are referenced throughout the questionnaire.

### Criterion Rating Scale

Used for scoring every individual TRUST criterion (TR1--TR3, RE1--RE3, UC1--UC4, SE1--SE4, TC1--TC2).

| Score | Label              | Meaning                                                      |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Fails              | The criterion is not met; significant deficiency found.      |
| 1     | Partial/unclear    | Some evidence exists but is incomplete or inconsistent.      |
| 2     | Meets baseline     | The criterion is satisfactorily met with adequate evidence.  |
| 3     | Strong             | The criterion is exceeded with compelling, well-documented evidence. |

### Final Recommendation Options

| Value                        | Meaning                                                                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommended                  | Tool meets TRUST standards for the evaluated use case(s).                       |
| Recommended with caveats     | Tool is acceptable but requires specific conditions or monitoring.               |
| Needs review/provisional     | Insufficient evidence or minor concerns; requires further evaluation.            |
| Pilot only                   | Tool may be used in a limited pilot but not for broad deployment.                |
| Not recommended              | Tool does not meet TRUST standards for the evaluated use case(s).                |
| Out of scope                  | Tool falls outside the evaluation scope as defined in Section 1.                 |

### Confidence Levels

| Value  | Meaning                                                          |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High   | Evaluation evidence is thorough and unambiguous.                 |
| Medium | Evaluation evidence is adequate but some gaps remain.            |
| Low    | Evaluation evidence is insufficient or significant uncertainty.  |

### Critical-Fail Flags (Checkboxes)

A checked flag indicates a critical deficiency that must be resolved before the tool can receive a positive recommendation. Multiple flags may be checked.

- [ ] Fabricated or unverifiable citation found
- [ ] Materially unfaithful synthesis found
- [ ] Major claim not traceable to a primary source
- [ ] Provenance path not inspectable enough for academic use
- [ ] Privacy/data-use terms unclear or unacceptable
- [ ] Serious security/compliance concern
- [ ] Serious bias/fairness concern without credible mitigation

## Appendix A -- Field Summary Reference

The table below provides a quick reference for the **questionnaire specification** section counts only.

It does **not** include persisted review-record envelope metadata, and it does **not** define the runtime field-definition totals in `static/js/config/questionnaire-schema.js`.

| Section | Title                        | Field count |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 0       | Workflow Control             | 6           |
| 1       | Tool Profile                 | 10          |
| 2       | Evaluation Setup             | 10          |
| 3       | Transparent (TR)             | 14          |
| 4       | Reliable (RE)                | 16          |
| 5       | User-Centric (UC)            | 20          |
| 6       | Secure (SE)                  | 18          |
| 7       | Traceable (TC)               | 11          |
| 8       | Critical Fails and Confidence| 4           |
| 9       | Overall Recommendation       | 7           |
| 10A     | Primary Evaluation Handoff   | 4           |
| 10B     | Second Review                | 6           |
| 10C     | Final Team Decision          | 6           |
| **Total** |                             | **132**     |

### Current Count Status (T001)

The repository does not currently present one reconciled field total. The counts below refer to different layers and should not be merged into a single number until the repo is reconciled.

| Source / layer | Count | Interpretation |
|----------------|-------|----------------|
| Appendix A total in this document | 132 | Current questionnaire-spec summary table total. |
| Explicit section-by-section listings in this document | 135 | Body-content count. This differs from Appendix A because Section 6 explicitly lists 21 fields while the appendix row still says 18. |
| Runtime field definitions in `static/js/config/questionnaire-schema.js` | 123 | Live runtime field-id namespace. This count includes derived-only field definitions. |
| Runtime non-derived input field definitions | 117 | Runtime field definitions excluding the 6 derived-only ids (`tr/re/uc/se/tc.principleJudgment` and `s8.completionChecklist`). |
| Actual persisted `current_state_json.fields` entries per saved review | Variable | Sparse stored response keys. This is not a fixed total and depends on review completeness and field activity. |

Known current causes of divergence:

- `static/js/config/questionnaire-schema.js` adds four Section 0 runtime fields not listed in the questionnaire body: `s0.reviewerName`, `s0.reviewerEmail`, `s0.reviewerAffiliation`, and `s0.reviewDate`.
- The questionnaire body lists separate criterion fields for `Evidence summary` and `Evidence links`, while the runtime schema currently defines one combined `${criterion}.evidence` field per criterion. For T002, the split wording remains a questionnaire-spec prompt model, not the canonical runtime/export-package model; legacy summary/link text must be normalized into the durable asset/link evidence system before or during import.
- Section `2.10 Evidence folder link` remains part of the questionnaire specification for reproducibility and shared-folder workflows, but it is not the canonical durable evidence record in the T002 contracts.
- The runtime field-definition total and the questionnaire-spec total answer different questions; neither should be restated as the other's canonical count.

## Appendix B -- Scoring Guidance

When assigning scores to individual TRUST criteria, apply the following guidance consistently:

- **Score 0 (Fails):** Assign when there is no evidence that the criterion is met, or when evidence directly contradicts the criterion. This score triggers the critical-fail review process.
- **Score 1 (Partial/unclear):** Assign when some relevant evidence exists but is incomplete, inconsistent, or insufficient to confirm the criterion is met. The "Uncertainty or blockers" field must be completed.
- **Score 2 (Meets baseline):** Assign when the criterion is satisfactorily met. Evidence is adequate, documented, and supports a positive assessment without significant gaps.
- **Score 3 (Strong):** Assign when the tool exceeds the criterion with compelling, well-documented evidence. This score should be reserved for cases where the tool demonstrably goes beyond baseline expectations.

### Principle Judgment Rules

A principle receives an overall judgment based on its constituent criterion scores:

- **Pass:** All criteria score 2 or higher, with at most one criterion scoring 2 and the rest scoring 3.
- **Conditional pass:** At least one criterion scores 1, but no criteria score 0. Conditions must be documented in the principle summary.
- **Fail:** Any criterion scores 0. This triggers the critical-fail flag review in Section 8.
